FLASHING YOUR OWN CODE.

The NumMPad uses a PI Pico as its controller, so you will need to flash the .UF2 file to it.

To flash flip the switch on the top of the NumMPad to the right and plug it back in, once the file explororer auto opens, flip the switch back to the left and drop the code you want into it.

For more indepth details about the NumMPad, please look into the Documentation.
